It's a big effort to organize a testing event. Things easily may slip your mind. Here's a checklist for organizing a successful IRO testing event.

## Planning & Organization

* Make sure to collect phone numbers and emails of participants when they apply.
* Create a social media group (Whatsapp, Telegram, Facebook etc.) and add everyone.
  - Make regular updates about the events.
  - Ensure that every update and announcement is also written in English.
  - Of course everyone can use Google Translate but as the organizer it's a good deed to provide translated announcements.

## Hosting the judge(s)

* Ask them about food allergies.
* Ask them about medical conditions, drug allergies and whether there are any medicines that they take every day or on a routine basis.
* Make sure they have contact info of people from the organization in case they need anything.
* Provide decent and clean toilet arrangement in nose work and obedience/dexterity areas.
  - Make sure there soap or hand sanitizers and paper towels.

## Timetable

* If you plan to determine the order by drawing lots then prepare the papers and drawing bag.
* Create a spreadsheet (Microsoft Excel document) and share it with participants.

## Educating helpers

* Make sure the translator knows the IRO testing terms and concepts.
  - It would be good if the translator reads the testing rules PDF before the testing day.
  - If that's a lot to ask then an experienced dog handler should summarize the concepts to the translator.
* Make sure victims and testing helpers reads the related page: [Responsibilities of helpers in tests](/responsibilities-of-testing-helpers/)
